Requirements
1. You will use the given code, lecture material, and RISC-V reference manual to develop a C program which can read RISC-V machine code and emulate what the instructions would do on a real processor.
1. For reference see the [RISC-V ISA Specification Volume 1](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMAFDQC/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf)
    1. Chapter 2 RV32I Base Integer Instruction  Set (pages 13-24)
    1. Chapter 5 RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set (pages 35-40) 
    1. Chapter 7 "M" Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division (pages 43-44)
    1. Chapter 24 RV32/64G Instruction Set Listings (pages 129-131
    1. Chapter 25 RISC-V Assembly Programmers Handbook - Pseudo Instructions (pages 137-140)
    1. [General  RISC-V emulation guide](https://github.com/usfca-cs-tools/docs/blob/main/risc-v-emulation.md)
1. You do not need to emulate the whole RISC-V processor -- just enough to execute the given assembly programs: `quadratic_s`, `midpoint_s`, `max3_s`, and `get_bitseq_s`.
1. The given code provides a framework for testing that the emulator output matches the output of the C and assembly language versions of the programs
1. Your emulator will need logic, including data processing (`add`, `mv`, `sub`, etc.) and branching (`j`, `bCC`, `jal` (`call`), `jalr` (`ret`)) to run the programs
1. Your emulator will need state, including the general purpose registers and the program counter (`pc`)

## Example Output
    $ ./lab04 quadratic 2 4 6 8
    C: 36
    Asm: 36
    Emu: 36

    $ ./lab04 midpoint 0 4
    C: 2
    Asm: 2
    Emu: 2

    $ ./lab04 max3 3 8 5
    C: 8
    Asm: 8
    Emu: 8

    $ ./lab04 get_bitseq 94117 12 15
    C: 6
    Asm: 6
    Emu: 6
