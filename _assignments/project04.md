## Requirements 

1. You will write an emulator in C for a subset of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). 
1. You do not have to emulate the entire instruction set - just enough to emulate the given implementations of `fib_rec`, `get_bitseq`, `int_to_str`, `is_pal`, `max3`, `quadratic`, `sort`, `str_to_int`, and `to_upper`. 
1. Your emulator will need the logic (decoding and emulating instructions) and state (`rv_state`) from lab04
1. Your emulator will support dynamic analysis of instruction execution. Here are the metrics you will collect:
    1. \# of instructions executed (`i_count`)
    1. \# of I-type and R-type instructions executed (`ir_count`)
    1. \# of LD instructions executed (`ld_count`)
    1. \# of ST instructions executed (`st_count`)
    1. \# of jump instructions executed including `j`, `jal`, `jalr` (`j_count`)
    1. \# of conditional branches taken (`b_taken`)
    1. \# of conditional branches not taken (`b_not_taken`)
1. Your emulator will include an implementation of a processor cache simulator for the following cache types: 
    1. A direct mapped cache with a block size on 1 word (given)
    1. A direct mapped cache with a block size of 4 words
    1. A 4-way set associative cache with a block size of 1 word and LRU slot replacement
    1. A 4-way set associative cache with a block size of 4 words and LRU slot replacement

## Given
1. In lecture and lab, we will: 
    1. illustrate how to decode machine code and execute the operations specified
    1. illustrate a direct-mapped cache and describe the data structures and algorithms required for a set-associative cache
    1. We have written a [Guide to Cache Memory](/docs/cache-memory.html) to help you develop your cache implementation
1. In-class coding will be pushed to Github. You will provide the rest of the code yourself
1. You will need to `git pull` in the tests repo to get this semester's test cases

## Grading Rubric
**Automated testing**

70 pts: Automated tests

**Code Review**

10 pts: code walkthrough including, but not limited to, your implementation of dynamic analysis and the instruction cache.

**Coding Style**

20 pts: Clean repo, consistent naming and indentation, no dead code, no unnecessarily complex code
