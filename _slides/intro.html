# What is Computer Architecture?

1. Instruction Set Architecture: How do we program a computer processor? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Microarchitecture: How is the processor internally implemented? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Performance: How do processors run code so fast? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
___
## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

1. Humans program processors using assembly language source code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Compilers generate machine code which is a binary representation of assembly language <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. You will learn how to program a processor using its ISA <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
___
## Microarchitecture 

1. Processors are electrical devices composed of wires and transistors <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Transistors are used to build circuits to make memory and logic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. You will learn how to build those circuits in a simulated environment <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
___
## What are some examples of Architectures?

1. The most widely known architectures are Intel's x86 (PCs) and ARM (most mobile devices) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. We will learn a new architecture called RISC-V <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. RISC-V is open source, and free to use <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Syllabus and Policies

1. Course Style
1. Classroom Culture
1. Logistics
1. Notable Policies
___
## Course Style

1. Learn by doing: labs and projects <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Something due every week: start early <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Test-Driven Development <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Midterm and Final Exam <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
___
## Classroom Culture

1. Please ask questions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Students who ask questions get the highest grades (why?) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Attendance will be graded :-( <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

___
## Logistics

1. Web site: [https://usf-cs315-s25.github.io](https://usf-cs315-s25.github.io) contains daily video, code, and notes
1. Video recordings: Zoom (USF auth required)
1. Tech support: CampusWire Class Feed (not email or DM)
1. OH on Syllabus for Phil, Smrithi, and Stephanie
___
## Policies

1. Late work
1. Plagiarism
1. Grading scale

---
# Icebreaker

1. Your name (nickname? pronouns?)
1. Hometown
1. Something interesting you did over winter break

---
## Need a Refresher?

1. [Shell basics](https://github.com/usfca-cs-tools/docs/blob/main/shell-basics.md)
1. [git part 1](https://github.com/usfca-cs-tools/docs/blob/main/git-basics.md)
1. [git part 2](https://github.com/usfca-cs-tools/docs/blob/main/git-next-steps.md)
1. [gdb](https://github.com/usfca-cs-tools/docs/blob/main/gdb-debugging.md)
1. [C style](https://github.com/usfca-cs-tools/docs/blob/main/c-style.md)

I assume this is mostly review but questions are welcome at any time
